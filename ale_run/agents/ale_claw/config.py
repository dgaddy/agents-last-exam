"""AleClawConfig: per-episode knobs for the OpenClaw native agent deployer.

Standalone config (no shared base). Declares ``model`` / ``max_turns``
(mapped to OpenClaw's ``max_steps``) plus the OpenClaw-specific knobs
below. The episode wall-budget is orchestration-owned, so this config no
longer carries ``timeout_s``.

API keys normally live in the operator's shell environment. The deployer
never touches ``os.environ`` — litellm (the harness's LLM
client) reads ``OPENROUTER_API_KEY`` / ``ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`` /
``OPENAI_API_KEY`` directly from the process's env vars, which the
operator populates via shell ``source`` of an ``.env`` / ``.envrc``.
For docker / VM runtimes those vars are propagated by
:mod:`ale.runtime._env`.

Typical usage::

    # In shell:
    #   export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=...
    #   for f in secret/eval_time/*.env; do source "$f"; done

    cfg = AleClawConfig(
        model="openrouter/anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
        max_turns=100,
